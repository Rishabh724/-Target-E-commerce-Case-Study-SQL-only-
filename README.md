The analysis focuses on business problem-solving, metric definition, and insight-driven recommendations, mirroring the responsibilities of a Data Analyst / Business Analyst role.

Tools: Google BigQuery
Core Skill Demonstrated: Translating raw data into actionable business insights using SQL

Business Goals

- Data Validation: Schema audit via INFORMATION_SCHEMA
- Trends: Monthly & YoY order analysis using window functions (LAG)
- Seasonality: Month-wise and time-of-day demand patterns
- Geography: State-level order volume, revenue, and customer spread
- Economics: Order value growth, average price & freight by state
- Delivery KPIs: Actual delivery time vs estimated (DATE_DIFF)
- Payments: MoM payment type usage & installment behavior


🎯 Business Goals

- Analyze order growth, seasonality, and customer behavior

- Identify high-value vs high-volume regions

- Evaluate freight cost and delivery performance

- Understand payment method adoption and installment behavior

- Provide data-backed business recommendations


🔍 Analysis Performed (SQL)

- Data Validation: Schema audit via INFORMATION_SCHEMA to verify column types and data quality

- Trends: Monthly and YoY order analysis using window functions (LAG)

- Seasonality: Month-wise trends and time-of-day demand patterns

- Geography: State-level order volume, revenue, and customer distribution

- Economics: Order value growth, average order price, and freight cost by state

- Delivery KPIs: Actual delivery time vs estimated delivery using DATE_DIFF

- Payments: Month-on-month payment type usage and installment behavior analysis

📊 Key Insights

- Strong growth observed from 2016 to 2017, with moderate growth in 2018
